*Currency Converter

Currency Converter is a simple web application that allows users to convert an amount from one currency to another using real-time exchange rates obtained from an API. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

*Features

Select the source and target currencies from a dropdown menu.
Dynamically displays the flag of the selected currencies.
Allows users to input the amount to be converted.
Fetches the exchange rate from a reliable API ("https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/").
Displays the converted amount based on the selected currencies and exchange rate.

*How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the "index.html" file in your web browser.
Choose the source and target currencies from the dropdowns.
Enter the amount you want to convert in the input field.
Click on the "Get Exchange Rate" button to see the converted amount.
You can also click on the exchange icon to swap the source and target currencies.

*Dependencies

The application uses the following external resources:

"countries.js": A JavaScript file containing a "Country_List" object with currency code and country name mappings.
"style.css": A CSS file that styles the Currency Converter web application.
API Usage
The application fetches exchange rate data from the "https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/" API. The API key used in the code may have usage limits, so you may want to sign up on the API website to obtain your own API key for more extensive usage.

*Notes
Please ensure that you have an active internet connection while using the Currency Converter to fetch the latest exchange rates.
The exchange rates may fluctuate based on the API data, and the provided results are indicative only.
